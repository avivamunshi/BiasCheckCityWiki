        "# Requesting ORES scores through LiftWing ML Service API\n",
        "Wikimedia Foundation (WMF) is reworking access to their APIs. It is likely in the coming years that all API access will require some kind of authentication, either through a simple key/token or through some version of OAuth. For now this is still a work in progress. You can follow the progress from their [API portal](https://api.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page). Another on-going change is better control over API services in situations where those services require additional computational resources, beyond simply serving the text of a web page (i.e., the text of an article). Services like ORES that require running an ML model over the text of an article page is an example of a compute intensive API service.\n",
        "\n",
        "Wikimedia is implementing a new Machine Learning (ML) service infrastructure that they call [LiftWing](https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Machine_Learning/LiftWing). Given that ORES already has several ML models that have been well used, ORES is the first set of APIs that are being moved to LiftWing.\n",
        "\n",
        "This code generates article quality estimates for article revisions using the LiftWing version of [ORES](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/ORES). The [ORES API documentation](https://ores.wikimedia.org) can be accessed from the main ORES page. The [ORES LiftWing documentation](https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Machine_Learning/LiftWing/Usage) is very thin ... even thinner than the standard ORES documentation. Further, it is clear that some parameters have been renamed (e.g., \"revid\" in the old ORES API is now \"rev_id\" in the LiftWing ORES API).\n",

        "You will need a Wikimedia user account to get access to Lift Wing (the ML API service). You can either [create an account or login](https://api.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin). If you have a Wikipedia user account - you might already have an Wikimedia account. If you are not sure try your Wikipedia username and password to check it. If you do not have a Wikimedia account you will need to create an account that you can use to get an access token.\n",
        "\n",
        "There is [a 'guide' that describes how to get authentication tokens](https://api.wikimedia.org/wiki/Authentication) - but not everything works the way it is described in that documentation. You should review that documentation and then read the rest of this comment.\n",
        "\n",
        "The documentation talks about using a \"dashboard\" for managing authentication tokens. That's a rather generous description for what looks like a simple list of token things. You might have a hard time finding this \"dashboard\". First, on the left hand side of the page, you'll see a column of links. The bottom section is a set of links titled \"Tools\". In that section is a link that says [Special pages](https://api.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:SpecialPages) which will take you to a list of ... well, special pages. At the very bottom of the \"Special pages\" page is a section titled \"Other special pages\" (scroll all the way to the bottom). The first link in that section is called [API keys](https://api.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:AppManagement). When you get to the \"API keys\" page you can create a new key.\n",
        "\n",
        "The authentication guide suggests that you should create a server-side app key. This does not seem to work correctly - as yet. It failed on multiple attempts when I attempted to create a server-side app key. BUT, there is an option to create a [Personal API token](https://api.wikimedia.org/wiki/Authentication) that should work for this course and the type of ORES page scoring that you will need to perform.\n",
        "\n",
        "Note, when you create a Personal API token you are granted the three items - a Client ID, a Client secret, and a Access token - you shold save all three of these. When you dismiss the box they are gone. If you lose any one of the tokens you can destroy or deactivate the Personal API token from the dashboard and then create a new one.\n",

        "The value you need to work the code below is the Access token - a very long string.\n"
